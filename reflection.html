        <p> This course was pretty fun. First we learned the basics of binary an hexadecimal numbers. We then went into VS Code and learned C and Javascript. In the second semester we learned web design. Second Semester was my favorite!</p>
        <p> We learned about the basics of c. It was a good introduction into the course. While learning it, we also learned the basics of the terminal. It was very interesting.</p>
        <p> We also learned about vim and how overcomplicated it is. In order to escape the pain of vim we decided to use vs code. We had to learn how to install the ubuntu and use vs code in there. </p>
        <p> We then went into web design and I made a really cool website. My website was called Palmer's Peculiar Places. We sell Peculiar places to people.The website had a secret rickroll in it. I had a lot of fun with it and worked really hard. </p>
